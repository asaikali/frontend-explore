# Vue 3 + TypeScript + Vite

This template should help get you started developing with Vue 3 and TypeScript in Vite. The template uses Vue 3 `<script setup>` SFCs, check out the [script setup docs](https://v3.vuejs.org/api/sfc-script-setup.html#sfc-script-setup) to learn more.

Learn more about the recommended Project Setup and IDE Support in the [Vue Docs TypeScript Guide](https://vuejs.org/guide/typescript/overview.html#project-setup).


That's a great way to explore Vue.js! Vue offers many powerful features like reactivity, component-based architecture, directives, and state management. To get a comprehensive understanding of Vue, you can create a series of components that touch on its various strengths. Here's a suggested list of components that will help you explore the key features of Vue.js:

### 1. **Counter Component**
   - **Key Features:** Data binding, reactivity, event handling
   - A simple component with a button to increment/decrement a counter. This will showcase Vue’s reactivity and event handling.

### 2. **Todo List**
   - **Key Features:** Lists rendering, input handling, reactivity, event binding
   - A component where you can add, delete, and mark tasks as complete. This will help you practice using Vue's `v-for` directive and event handling with form inputs.

### 3. **Modal Component**
   - **Key Features:** Slots, conditional rendering
   - Create a modal (popup) component that can display different content using Vue's slots and `v-if` for conditional rendering.

### 4. **Tabs Component**
   - **Key Features:** Dynamic components, reactivity, conditional rendering
   - A tabbed interface where clicking on different tabs changes the content below. This helps you work with dynamic components and reactivity.

### 5. **Searchable Dropdown**
   - **Key Features:** Two-way binding, computed properties, event handling
   - A dropdown component with a search bar at the top. As the user types, the list filters based on the input.

### 6. **Image Gallery with Lazy Loading**
   - **Key Features:** `v-lazy` directive, lifecycle hooks
   - Create an image gallery that loads images lazily as the user scrolls, leveraging Vue's lifecycle hooks and directives for performance optimization.

### 7. **Form Validation**
   - **Key Features:** Two-way binding, custom directives, form handling
   - A component with a form where you validate inputs (e.g., email, password) and display errors. You can use custom Vue directives and `v-model` for input handling.

### 8. **Dynamic Chart Component**
   - **Key Features:** Third-party libraries integration (e.g., Chart.js), props, watchers
   - Integrate a charting library (like Chart.js) into Vue to visualize data dynamically as it updates. Practice using props and watchers.

### 9. **Todo List with Vuex (State Management)**
   - **Key Features:** Vuex (state management)
   - Extend the earlier Todo List by introducing Vuex to handle global state, showcasing how to manage shared state in a larger app.

### 10. **Drag and Drop List**
   - **Key Features:** Custom events, reactivity, event modifiers
   - Build a list of items that can be reordered via drag-and-drop functionality, helping you explore custom events and more complex DOM interactions.

### 11. **Pagination Component**
   - **Key Features:** Props, event emitters, reactivity
   - Create a reusable pagination component that can manage large sets of data and navigate between pages of items.

### 12. **Reactive User Profile Card**
   - **Key Features:** Reactive data, dynamic class and style bindings
   - Build a user profile card where the styles and class names change dynamically based on the user’s data (e.g., VIP users get different styles).

### 13. **File Upload Component**
   - **Key Features:** File input handling, custom events, validation
   - A component that allows users to upload files with validation for file types and sizes. This will explore handling file inputs and emitting custom events.

### 14. **Global Notification System**
   - **Key Features:** Global event bus, Vuex (optional), dynamic components
   - A system for displaying notifications or alerts globally across the app. This helps you practice building reusable components that interact across the app.

### 15. **Real-time Chat Component**
   - **Key Features:** WebSockets, reactivity, event handling
   - A simple real-time chat app using WebSockets. This is great for testing Vue’s ability to handle asynchronous updates and real-time interactions.
