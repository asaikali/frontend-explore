  <p> Next, you meet a fisher. You can say one of several greetings:
  <dl>
    <dt> "Hello there!"
    <dd>
      <p> She responds with "Hello, how may I help you?"; you can respond with:
      <dl>
        <dt> "I would like to buy a fish."
        <dd> <p> She sells you a fish and the conversation finishes.
        <dt> "Can I borrow your boat?"
        <dd>
          <p> She is surprised and asks "What are you offering in return?".
          <dl>
            <dt> "Five gold." (if you have enough)
            <dt> "Ten gold." (if you have enough)
            <dt> "Fifteen gold." (if you have enough)
            <dd> <p> She lends you her boat. The conversation ends.
            <dt> "A fish." (if you have one)
            <dt> "A newspaper." (if you have one)
            <dt> "A pebble." (if you have one)
            <dd> <p> "No thanks", she replies. Your conversation options
              at this point are the same as they were after asking to borrow
              her boat, minus any options you've suggested before.
          </dl>
        </dd>
      </dl>
    </dd>
    <dt> "Vote for me in the next election!"
    <dd> <p> She turns away. The conversation finishes.
    <dt> "Madam, are you aware that your fish are running away?"
    <dd>
      <p> She looks at you skeptically and says "Fish cannot run, miss".
      <dl>
        <dt> "You got me!"
        <dd> <p> The fisher sighs and the conversation ends.
        <dt> "Only kidding."
        <dd> <p> "Good one!" she retorts. Your conversation options at this
          point are the same as those following "Hello there!" above.
        <dt> "Oh, then what are they doing?"
        <dd> <p> She looks at her fish, giving you an opportunity to steal
          her boat, which you do. The conversation ends.
      </dl>
    </dd>
